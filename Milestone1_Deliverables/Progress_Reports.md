## Progress Reports Plan

**How will we track progress?**

> We will track progress using our communication platforms including SMS and Discord while using a sole
GitHub repository as the primary source of truth over the life of the project. Each team member
will have a local branch which we will regularly merge back into the main after discussing work done,
as a group, with the goal of incremental and parallelized development over the period of the
competition.

**Short progress update outline:**

For each progress update on each milestone, we will likely submit a comprehensive report containing:

- All commits made to the repository since the last report.
- A detailed explanation of each commit, why it was made, and its functionality that goes beyond the
standard commit comment.
- Any relevant outside materials, sources, or references that have been used either directly or as
inspiration to the project.
- Note any changes in our meta-level plan to complete our project and enter into the Kaggle competition.
- An abstract, high-level explanation of the project as it exists in its current state that explains our
architectural, engineering, and design decisions.
- Any other relevant comments, information, or material we might contextually decide is necessary to
include in our explanation.
