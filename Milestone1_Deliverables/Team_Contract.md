## Team Contract

**Roles & responsibilities:** Because this is only a small two-person team, we would like to split
the roles and responsibilities somewhat equally as this seems fair. Our idea was that both of us
would work through the project in parallel and then make weekly/bi-weekly merges to a unified github
repository after discussing our work over the period together. We thought parallelizing the workflow
for this challenge might offer better efficiency for the kind of problem we are trying to solve.

**Communication Expectations:** As mentioned, we are aiming for weekly or bi-weekly meetings. I'd
imagine we will also discuss this before and after our classes together on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Discord and text messaging are the preferred platforms of communication.

**Deadlines & accountability:** This isn't perfectly set in stone due to our small team size. If any
work is missed, we will need to momentarily assess with whom it would be most efficient to offload
the extra work, contextually. We'd like to aim to make 3 submissions to the Kaggle comptetition over
the run of the project's lifetime if possible, working out to roughly one attempt a month.

**Conflict resolution:** Again, being a two-person team our conflict resolution structure is likely
to remain relatively relaxed and interpersonal. If we cannot come to an agreement for any reason
whatsoever then some sort of future third-party arbiter would necessarily need to be agreed upon.
